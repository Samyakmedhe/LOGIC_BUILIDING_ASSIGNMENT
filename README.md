ðŸ“˜ Logic Building Assignment Repository
This repository contains a series of programming assignments focused on improving logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and core programming fundamentals using C, C++, and Java.


ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The repository is organized into multiple folders, each representing a specific assignment:


/Assignment_1
/Assignment_2
...
/Assignment_14


Each folder contains source code files targeting different logical problems such as:
Number patterns
Recursion
String and array manipulation
Mathematical logic
Bitwise operations
Custom algorithms
Sorting and searching techniques
ðŸ’» Languages Used
: C 
: Java
: C++ 

Compile and run the program using:
For C   : gcc filename.c -o output && ./output
For C++ : g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output
For Java: javac filename.java && java filename


This diverse mix ensures strong command over syntax, logic, and problem-solving in each language.
