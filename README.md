# 🧠 Logic Building Assignments



---

## 📘 About the Repository

This repository contains a series of **logic-building assignments** developed using **C, C++, and Java**.  
It is designed to enhance:

- 🧠 Problem-solving skills  
- 🧩 Algorithmic thinking  
- 💡 Programming foundation for interviews, competitive coding, and academics

Each assignment includes hand-written programs solving real-world logic problems like number patterns, recursion, arrays, strings, and more.

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
# ---------------------------------------
# 📦 How to Compile and Run Assignments
# ---------------------------------------

# ✅ For C files
gcc filename.c -o output
./output

# ✅ For C++ files
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output

# ✅ For Java files
javac filename.java
java filename

# 📝 Notes:
# - Ensure GCC, G++ and Java JDK are installed on your machine.
# - Use 'cd Assignment_X' to go into the folder before compiling.
# - Each file is self-contained and runnable individually.
